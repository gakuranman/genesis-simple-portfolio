Adds a portfolio custom post type to any WordPress theme, with support for the Genesis framework.

== Description ==

This is a lightweight and simple plugin that adds a custom post type ('portfolio') with two clean taxonomies ('types' and 'labels') to your WordPress installation. It can be used for creating a portfolio on any WordPress theme, and also includes special support for the Genesis framework. One or more portfolios can be created with a wide variety of uses, such as a photography album, personal project listings and work services. The plugin also features a few nifty extras to enhance the user experience by adding featured image thumbnails and a filtering system to the Portfolio admin menu for easy searching through your items.

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents of the directory to /wp-content/plugins/ (or use the automatic installer).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Click on 'Portfolio' in the admin menu to add new items.
4. Create a file called 'archive.php' in your WordPress theme to view archive listings.

= Optional =

5. Create a file called 'archive-portfolio.php' in your WordPress theme in order to customise the portfolio archive listing.
6. Create files called 'taxonomy-type.php' and 'taxonomy-label.php' in your WordPress theme in order to customise the taxonomy archive listings.
