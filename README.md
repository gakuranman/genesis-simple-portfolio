Adds a portfolio custom post type to any WordPress website, with support for the Genesis framework.

## == Description ==

Genesis Simple Portfolio is a lightweight plugin that adds a custom post type ('portfolio') and two clean taxonomies ('types' and 'labels') to your WordPress installation. It can be used for creating a portfolio on any WordPress website, and also includes special support for the Genesis framework and child themes.

The plugin also features a few nifty extras to enhance your experience. You'll see featured image thumbnails in the Portfolio admin menus and also a filtering system to help you search through your items!

Example uses for the portfolio include displaying photography albums, showing past projects and advertising work services.

Please note - this plugin does not control how portfolio items are displayed on your WordPress theme. For more information on how to customise your theme, please visit the Genesis Simple Portfolio plugin homepage: http://gakuran.com/genesis-simple-portfolio/

## == Installation ==

1. Upload contents of the directory to /wp-content/plugins/ (or use the automatic installer).
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Click on 'Portfolio' in the admin menu to add new items.

= Optional =

4. Create a file called 'archive.php' in your WordPress theme to view archive listings.
5. Create a file called 'archive-portfolio.php' in your WordPress theme in order to customise the portfolio archive listing.
6. Create files called 'taxonomy-type.php' and 'taxonomy-label.php' in your WordPress theme in order to customise the taxonomy archive listings.

= After De-activating =

7. If deactivating the plugin, please visit the Settings > Permalinks page in the WordPress menu to update your URL structures after doing so. Just visiting this page (no need to even click 'Save Changes') will flush the rewrite rules and make sure everything is working correctly on your website.

## == Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Do I need Genesis in order to use this plugin?

No, you can use this plugin on any WordPress website or theme. The plugin includes special support for the Genesis framework (such as adding a Portfolio Archive Settings page), but this does not affect usage on regular WordPress websites.
